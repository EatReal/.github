<br /><br />
Nomad3 is a platform that lets event nomads forge meaningful memorable connections. It's designed for enthusiasts of web3 events and conferences, enabling them to authenticate their attendance, manage event interactions, and create lasting memories on the blockchain. 


## Project Description üìî
### ‚ùó‚ùó Problem Statement ‚ùó‚ùó
The web3 event landscape currently lacks a comprehensive platform for attendees to authenticate their presence, manage their event interactions, and create lasting memories in a unified and meaningful way.

### ‚ú®‚ú® Vision ‚ú®‚ú®
Nomad3 aims to transform the web3 event experience. It offers a unique platform for users to authenticate their event attendance, manage past and upcoming events, connect with fellow attendees, and create a digital narrative of their event journey.

### ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Unique Value Proposition ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è
Nomad3 distinguishes itself with several innovative features:

- **Seamless Wallet Connectivity**: Facilitates user authentication and interaction through embedded wallet address connections, offering a streamlined user experience and removing the need for private keys and long seed phrases.

- **ERC-6551 Token-Bound Account (TBA) Deployment**: Upon claiming an event NFT, a TBA is automatically deployed for each user. This account acts as a personal hub for managing event-related activities, including adding new connections and uploading pictures.

- **Personalized NFT Profiles**: Each user's event journey is captured and represented as a unique NFT profile, created using the ERC-6551 contract, providing a verifiable and personal record of their event experiences.

- **Event Interaction Management**: The TBA enables users to manage their event interactions, including recording connections made at events, stored in an organized array.

- **IPFS-Enabled Photo Sharing**: Users can upload pictures from events, which are stored as IPFS hashes, ensuring a decentralized and permanent storage solution. This feature allows users to revisit and cherish their event memories securely and reliably.

## How It's Made ü¶ø
The platform's functionality follows a specific flow:

1. **Event Registration by Organizers**: Organizers register events in the Nomad3Drops contract, receiving an eventID.
2. **Event NFT Claim by Participants**: Participants claim their event NFT using the eventID, triggering the automatic deployment of a TBA.
3. **Interaction with TBA**: Participants use an interface and address combination to interact with their TBA, creating and managing their event experiences.
4. **Connection and Picture Management**: The TBA allows for the addition of connections and the uploading of pictures, with the latter stored as IPFS hashes for decentralized and secure access.

Nomad3 is more than an app; it's a comprehensive platform for web3 event enthusiasts to capture, share, and relive their experiences, fostering a community of connected, engaged participants in the evolving digital interaction landscape.
